            Everyone, who knows me well, knows this – I am a huge Beatlemaniac! Whenever I feel down, I listen to The Beatles. Whenever I feel bored, I listen to The Beatles. Feeling happy? I listen to, you guessed it right, The Beatles! This band, rising to popularity
            in the 60’s, is all over my playlist. I play their songs so much that people around me at times simply get annoyed. That still does not change my habit, though! I have shared my Beatlemania around the people around me. Now I would like to
            share it with you!

            <h3>How it started</h3>
            <p>
                Here is a quiz – how long do you think I have known the Beatles? If you guessed anything around 2 years, very good job! It may be pretty surprising to you that I first heard of the Beatles in 2019. Prior to that year, I do not think I ever heard of them,
                let alone listening to any of their songs (knowingly)! During the summer of 2019, I went to Memphis, TN. There, I paid a visit to my cousin, Zahid. My taste in music quite different at the time. Being raised in Bangladesh, I was used to
                listening to a lot of Bengali and Bollywood songs. Along with those, I would also jam to popular music artists like Billie Eilish, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa, Justin Bieber etc. One day, while I was being myself and playing my playlist,
                Zahid just randomly asked me “why don’t you listen to The Beatles?” I said, “Who?” “What? You never heard of The Beatles? They are the greatest band ever!”, he responded. “Well… ok, whatever!” I said to myself, being totally unaware of
                what the future was having in store for me. Zahid went on and started playing some songs of the Beatles. While the songs were playing, I was being busy on my phone, ignoring the music. Then came a song, that caught my attention. The music
                was really nice I thought, and so was the ending that was like “na na na na…” I came to know that the name of the song was Hey Jude. Hence, my journey as a Beatlemaniac began.

            <h3>More than just a band</h3>

            <p>
                You have already got a sense of the impact The Beatles has had on me. However, I am not the only person to be impacted by them. There are millions like me even in this era. The effect The Beatles had on the whole world was gigantic. So much so that there
                is documentary titled "How The Beatles Changed The World" (click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ov5BW0lWKw" target="_blank">here</a> to watch on YouTube). They changed the world not only through their ever-evolving
                music and sales records, but also by making an impact on the cultures, politics, and equal rights. Although singers writing lyrics is nothing unique today, it was totally unheard of when the Fab Four started doing it. The biggest attribute
                to their music, in my opinion, is the wide range of genres they covered including rock n’ roll, psychedelic rock, folk rock, baroque pop to name a few. They were also very vocal about their beliefs on politics and concurrent events at
                the time. In 1964, they refused to play in front of a segregated audience Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida. The refusal led to the first ever concert with a desegregated audience in the United States. They always wanted to spread peace
                and love. During the Vietnam War in 1968, The Beatles wrote the song Revolution in in response to the violence. Their influence outside of music only increased my love and respect for them.

            <h3>Favorite Songs</h3>

            <p>Being a big fan of The Beatles, it is very hard for me to list a few songs as my favorite. My list of favorite Beatles songs has only been growing every day! I put some effort in thinking deep and made a list of five of my favorite songs.
                If you never heard of them, I would recommend you start with these songs.</p>

            <h4>#1. Hey Jude</h4>

            <p>Ah, this song! This is where it all began for me. Every time I listen to this song, I automatically feel better. The lyrics and Sir Paul McCartney’s soothing voice never fail to make me feel better. And the “na na na na…” part at the end of
                the song is no less than medicine to me!</p>

            <h4>#2. I Want to Hold Your Hand</h4>

            <p>
                This classic pop-rock is from their early days. Every time I listen to its simple and jolly composition, I feel like dancing! After "Hey Jude", this is the song I liked and led me to listen to the more songs of them.
            </p>

            <h4>#3. Eleanor Rigby</h4>

            <p>
                This song is one of the prime examples of the variety of music the Beatles produced. The use of the instruments, the lyrics just give a different vibe and makes me think about life every time I listen to it. And to think that Sir Paul McCartney wrote
                this sing when he was in his early twenties just blows my mind!
            </p>

            <h4>#4. Here Comes the Sun</h4>

            <p>
                A George Harrison classic! The lead guitarist of the band, and the youngest one, showed how much he had evolved threw this song. This song brings me cheer and has a power to lift me up when I am having a bad day. It reminds me that there is always going
                to be light at the end of a dark tunnel.
            </p>

            <h4>#5. Yesterday</h4>
            <p>
                Have I told you yet that Sir Paul McCartney is my favorite Beatle? By the time I had heard this song, I had already started to like him more than the rest of the band members. "Yesterday" just made it official. And now, “I am not half the man I used to
                be!” Long live McCartney!
            </p>

            <h3>Your Thoughts?</h3>

            <p>
                I have shared my journey as a Beatlemaniac so far. It is a journey that is never going to end. I would love to know your thoughts on The Beatles. What are your favorite songs of The Beatles? Do you have any memories attached to them? Don’t shy away, "come
                together" and write in the comment box below!
